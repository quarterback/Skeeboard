# Complete GitHub Deployment Guide

## What You Have Now

I've created a complete, working ARM Rating Calculator in the `github-deployment-package/` folder:

- **index.html** - Complete standalone app (no dependencies)
- **README.md** - Documentation and instructions
- **.gitignore** - Git configuration

## Deploy to GitHub in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to github.com and click "New repository"
2. Name it: `arm-rating-calculator`
3. Make it public
4. Don't initialize with README (we have one)

### Step 2: Upload Files
1. Download/copy all files from `github-deployment-package/`
2. Upload them to your new repository:
   - Drag and drop all files into the GitHub interface
   - Or use git commands if you prefer

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to repository Settings â†’ Pages
2. Source: "Deploy from a branch"
3. Branch: "main" 
4. Folder: "/ (root)"
5. Click Save

Your app will be live at: `https://yourusername.github.io/arm-rating-calculator`

## Alternative: Instant Deploy

### Netlify (Fastest)
1. Go to netlify.com
2. Drag the `github-deployment-package` folder onto the deploy area
3. Your app is instantly live with a custom URL

### Vercel

2. Import your GitHub repository
