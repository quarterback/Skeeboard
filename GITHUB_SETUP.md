# Complete GitHub Deployment Setup

## Step 1: Get Your Files Ready for GitHub

I've created a complete working deployment in the `dist/` folder. Here's how to get it on GitHub and deployed:

### Copy the Working Files
1. Copy these files from your `dist/` folder to a new GitHub repository:
   - `index.html` (complete working app)
   - `index.js` (server file)
   - `package.json` (deployment config)

### Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to github.com and create a new repository
2. Name it: `alley-roller-calculator`
3. Upload the 3 files from your `dist/` folder

## Step 2: Deploy on Multiple Platforms

### Option A: Vercel (Recommended)
1. Go to vercel.com
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your repository
5. Set these build settings:
   - **Framework Preset**: Other
   - **Build Command**: `npm install`
   - **Output Directory**: `.` (root)
   - **Install Command**: `npm install`

### Option B: Netlify
1. Go to netlify.com
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Drag and drop your `dist/` folder contents
4. Your site will be live instantly

### Option C: Railway

## Step 4: Custom Domain (Optional)
All platforms allow custom domains:
- Buy a domain (like alleyroller.com)
- Add it in your platform's domain settings
- Your app will be live at your custom URL

## Testing Locally
To test the deployment package locally:
```bash
cd dist
npm install
npm start
```
Visit http://localhost:5000 to see your app.

Your Alley Roller Mastery Calculator will be live and working perfectly on any of these platforms!
