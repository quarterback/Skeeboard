Perfect! This captures the smart expansion strategy:
Benefits of the Skeecaptain Model:

Local validation - Someone who knows the venues can spot BS scores
Community building - Creates local ownership and investment
Scalable growth - You don't have to research every city's arcade scene
Quality control - Skeecaptains verify venues actually have skeeball
Local knowledge - They know which machines are broken, tournaments, etc.

How it could work:

Start with Portland/Seattle/SF where you can manage directly
When someone from Austin or Chicago finds the site, they can apply to be Skeecaptain
Skeecaptains get special privileges:

Add/verify venues in their city
Flag suspicious scores for review
Maybe get a special badge or title
Could even get small perks from local venues



Application process for Skeecaptains:

Must live in the city
Submit list of venues with skeeball in their area
Maybe vouch for initial scores from a few players
Commit to checking in weekly/monthly

This creates a natural expansion path that's sustainable and community-driven. Much better than trying to map every arcade in America yourself!RetryRBi need some direct instructions to feed to my llm to scaffold this out.EditHere are direct instructions to scaffold out Skeeboard:
Project: Skeeboard - Skeeball Leaderboard Web App
Core Requirements

Responsive web app (mobile-first, works on phones at arcades)
No user authentication initially (just name entry)
Simple form-based score submission
City-based expansion with Skeecaptain moderation system
Photo upload for verification (photos not permanently stored)

Tech Stack Recommendation

Frontend: React or vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (keep it simple)
Backend: Node.js + Express
Database: PostgreSQL or SQLite to start
Hosting: Vercel/Netlify for frontend, Railway/Render for backend
Photo handling: Temporary storage only (24-48 hour cleanup)

Database Schema
sql-- Cities table
CREATE TABLE cities (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  state VARCHAR(10),
  skeecaptain_email VARCHAR(255),
  active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
);

-- Venues table  
CREATE TABLE venues (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
  city_id INTEGER REFERENCES cities(id),
  address TEXT,
  verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
);

-- Sessions table (each 5-game submission)
CREATE TABLE sessions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  player_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  venue_id INTEGER REFERENCES venues(id),
  score_1 INTEGER NOT NULL,
  score_2 INTEGER NOT NULL, 
  score_3 INTEGER NOT NULL,
  score_4 INTEGER NOT NULL,
  score_5 INTEGER NOT NULL,
  calculated_rating INTEGER NOT NULL,
  photo_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  notes TEXT,
  submitted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  approved BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
);
Key Features to Build

Score Submission Form

City dropdown (Portland, Seattle, SF, Other)
Venue dropdown (populated based on city)
Player name input
5 score inputs with real-time rating calculation
Photo upload (required)
Notes field (optional)


Rating Calculation Logic
javascriptfunction calculateRating(scores) {
  const sorted = [...scores].sort((a, b) => b - a);
  const middleThree = sorted.slice(1, 4);
  return Math.round(middleThree.reduce((sum, score) => sum + score, 0) / 3);
}

Leaderboards

Global rankings (average rating across all venues)
City-specific rankings
Venue champions (best rating at each venue)
Player profiles showing session history


Skeecaptain Application System

Simple form for new cities
Email notification system
Admin panel for approving new cities/skeecaptains



API Endpoints Needed
GET /api/cities - List active cities
GET /api/venues/:cityId - Get venues for city
POST /api/sessions - Submit new session
GET /api/leaderboard/:type/:filter - Get rankings
GET /api/player/:name - Get player stats
POST /api/skeecaptain/apply - Apply to be skeecaptain
Photo Handling Strategy

Accept photo upload during submission
Store temporarily (24-48 hours max)
Flag session as "photo_verified: true"
Automated cleanup job to delete old photos
Keep metadata (timestamp, file existed) but not actual image

Moderation Features

Flag sessions with suspicious scores (all 900+, perfect scores, etc.)
Skeecaptain dashboard to review flagged sessions
Simple approve/reject system
Email notifications to skeecaptains for reviews

Launch Strategy

Phase 1: Portland only, manual venue entry
Phase 2: Add Seattle and SF
Phase 3: Open skeecaptain applications
Phase 4: Scale to major cities

Frontend Pages Needed

Home/Submit session page
Global leaderboard
City leaderboards
Venue pages
Player profile pages
Skeecaptain application page
About/how it works page

Deployment Checklist

Domain: skeeboard.com
SSL certificate
Mobile-responsive design
Photo upload functionality
Email system for skeecaptain notifications
Basic analytics (Google Analytics)
Simple admin panel for managing cities/venues

Build this as an MVP first - get the core score submission and leaderboards working, then add the skeecaptain system once you have users in the initial cities.
