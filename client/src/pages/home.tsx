          <p>
            The Alley Roller Metric (ARM) is a performance-based rating system designed for 5-game skee sessions. ARM scores range from 7.0 (beginner) to 25.0 (elite), and adjust based on how well you score compared to what's expected at your current level.
          </p>
          <p>
            To calculate your updated rating, enter your current ARM (or start at 7.0), your total number of sessions played, and the combined score from your most recent 5 games (each game is scored 0â€“900, for a maximum session total of 4500).
          </p>
          <p>
            New players see bigger rating swings as the system learns their level. After 5 sessions, your rating stabilizes and becomes more resistant to single-session highs or lows. Players with fewer than 5 sessions receive a provisional rating (e.g., 12.3p).

          This calculator uses the ARM (Alley Roller Metric) system to rate skeeball performance. Input your five individual game scores and current rating to calculate your new ARM rating.
